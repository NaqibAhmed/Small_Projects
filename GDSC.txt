My fellow students/friends and I receive excellent theoretical knowledge and information on our subjects. 
But we lack exposure to the practical and real-life problems to test our knowledge on. 
I want to allow us to gain experience and expertise by solving real-life problems. 
Becoming a lead and running a Google Developer Student Club will make it easier for me to create opportunities for my 
friends/students to learn and grow while solving many real-life problems.

The most difficult part of being a leader is resource management and decision-making. 
Few decisions come without compromise. 
In such situations I generally listen to all the arguments and take the best suitable decision with the lowest amount of compromize. 
As a leader I also find that managing time is the biggest obstacle in completion of project, planning in advance helps emencely.
But being a team leader have many benefits too, I really like to set the direction for growth and development of team and project.

Artificial intelligence and Machine learning are one of the most amazing and useful technology. I truly believe that it is the future of all the technology. It is truly fascinating to see a machine learn to perform a task. I have used this tech to make projects that do tedious, repetitive for us, or predict with certain accuracy whether a thing is possible or not. I believe there will be a future where all tedious tasks will be done by machines (thanks to ML), leaving humans will be able to do more creative and beautiful things.
